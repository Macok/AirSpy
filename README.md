# AirSpy #

Point your phone at the sky and get information about aircrafts flying over your head!

# How it works? #
AirSpy uses flightradar24.com data and your device's built in sensors (GPS, accelerometer, compass) to give you real-time data about nearby aircrafts.
For better accuracy, aircraft positions are approximated in real time using information about past position, bearing and speed.
